Features in Java8
-------------------
1. Interface Enhancement
2. Functional Interface
3. Lambda Expression
4. Stream API
5. Date & Time API


1 => Interface Enhancement
-----------------------------
a. Introduction of Default Methods => Supports backWard compatibility
    1. default method is available inside the implementing class
    2. there can be more than 1 default method in interface
    3. default method helps in bringing backward compatibility

b. Introduction of Static Methods =>
    1. static method is not available inside the implementing class
    2. there can be more than 1 static method in interface
    3. static method helps in bringing backward compatibility
    4. we can't override static method
    5. Java 8 onwards main method can be a part of  interface

c. Functional Interface
    1. An interface having one and only one abstract method is a functional
    2. Runnable interface had only 1 abstract method called run() => ex. functional interface
    3. Comparable interface had only 1 abstract method called compareTo() => ex. functional interface
    4. Functional Interface can have any number of default and static method but only 1 abstract method
       that's why it is also called as SAM interface

d. Lambda Expression
     - OOP -> Programming paradigm should adhere to Classes , Objects, Encapsulation , Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
     - Functional Programing -> Here implementation of same functionality can be done clear and concise manner
     => Code will less, implementation will compact

e. predicates => lmosmayat
    - Are predefined functional interfaces => predefined means mo7adad mosba9an
    - Return Boolean value

f. Double Colon Operator => can be used as an alternative to Lambda expression
    - method reference  -> instance and static method
    - constructor reference

g. Streams  - java.util.stream
    - Helps to operate on collection object
    - Filter takes a predicate as an argument so basically you are validating your input/collection against a condition,
    - whereas a Map allows you to define or use a existing function on the stream eg you can apply String.toUpperCase(...)
